## TODO 
 1. bedfile without exon number, permitted?
 1a. implement check points for wrong input or not enough input, dont have the pipeline just break (doesn't break, but checks for correct input are needed)
 3. identify AS
 4. output list of potentially false positive circles
 
 5. Parallelize
 6. Make it a real package

 To work with DCC bam files from mates separate mapping needs to be merged first and index (solved..though make a nicer script)

 identify types of multi circle transcripts
 
 within one circle (same boundaries) find different structures, skipped exons based on spliced reads...how?
 
 maybe include transcript_id gene name mapping within the scripts already

 integrate all tables and make figures
 
 PARALLELIZE
 
 add step option to pipeline..optional steps and required steps
 
 add the whole exonskipping, alternative splicing to pipeline
