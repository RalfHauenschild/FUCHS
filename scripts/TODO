## TODO 
 1. bedfile without exon number, permitted?
 1a. implement check points for wrong input or not enough input, dont have the pipeline just break (doesn't break, but checks for correct input are needed)
 1b. flexible number of clusters (done)
 1c. fix names in coverage profiles (done)
 2. one transcript per gene, choose best-fitting exon-structure seems to work more or less (done)
 3. identify AS
 4. output list of potentially false positive circles
 
 5. Parallelize
 6. Make it a real package
